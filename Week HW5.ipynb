    "In hypothesis testing, we use data from a sample (a small group) to make conclusions about a population (the whole group). The results of a test are focused on what we can learn about the population parameter (the true value for the whole population) based on the sample statistic (the number calculated from the sample). The key distinction is that we perform these tests to understand the population, even though we only use a small part of it (the sample) to draw conclusions. The purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis (which usually states there is no effect or difference) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (which suggests there is an effect or difference). The conclusions are always about the population, not just the sample."

So we then check if the p-value is extremely small, which would indicate that the null hypothesis is likely wrong. In that case, we reject H₀ and consider the alternative hypothesis(Ha). It's difficult to directly prove that Ha is correct so we test H0 to see if there is evidence strongly rejecting it. The two hypotheses are opposites of each other."
